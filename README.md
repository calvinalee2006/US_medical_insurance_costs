# US medical insurance costs project

### About the project
This was a project in the Data Science: machine learning career path in codecademy. This project focuses on data manipulation and how to use data to find the averages of male and female in surance costs based on specific factors. This was an open project meant for anybody to create there own project using the data provided.

### Personal Expereince with the project
I used the provided data (insurance.csv) to see differences in isurance costs between women under the age of 50 who live in the northwest that smoke and women under the age of 50 who live in the northwest who do 
not smoke. I had to look through online documentation, codecademy resources, and google to complete the project as accurately as I could. I found this code to be re-useable and the only downside to my code is that Body mass index (bmi) is not included into the equation.
